Repository for the Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react/ by Neil Cummings

You can find a live app here https://reactivities-sbp.herokuapp.com/

The differences between my version of the app and the one from the course is that I managed to port the entire course to React-Router-DOM v6, while the author is using the outdated v5

Feel free to fork the repository or to ask any question!
